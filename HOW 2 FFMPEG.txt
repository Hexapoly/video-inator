step 1 - get the latest ffmpeg-release-full.7z from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
step 2 - unpack it to some folder
step 3 - there should be ffmpeg.exe in unpackfolder/bin/ffmpeg.exe. move that ffmpeg.exe to ffmpeg/ in the program's folder.
step 4 - if you did it correctly, you should not get a popup stating ffmpeg is not installed when you run the program!
